For the phone tracking code I used Phonenumbers module along with timezone, geocoder, carrier. all explanations are mentioned in the program it self. 

By using this code we just get to know about the details of the phone owners like from where is it registered, which company is providing the network of the sim and in which coutry the phone number is from. 

along with I write the code where we get the location on google map. but I couldn't use exact locatiuon for the privacy purpose. but it may saw the country where moblile isn located. after running the program you need to input the number and it will saw the location of the phone. 

for the GPS of teh code I installed opencage moduel, also we should use folium package to popup the location in the GPS.
